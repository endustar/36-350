cat("    Hello Aliens! The following is a message from me, a represenative for the human species on planet Earth. We are a warm-blooded, carbon-based lifeform and we consider ourselves the dominant species on this planet. You will find many obvious visual differences among us, like our skin color, hair styles, or clothing as well as less obvious differences like our culture, prejudices, and languages. We are all here on this planet searching for love and happiness. We go to school to educate ourselves. This message is the result itself of my desire for a good grade in pursuit of that education. But if any aliens actually recieve this message, I would just like to say please don't colonize us. Thanks.")
